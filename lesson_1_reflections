How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

Viewing a diff showed me the lines that exist in one file but not the other. From there,
I could check if I have made any typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having easy access to the entire hitory of a file allows us to go back to previous version 
anytime if we want.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pros are that you have flexibility
The cons are that you need to remember to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git was created for programmers, and projects often contain more than one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to view the history of commits. Use git diff to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control let me go back to the version that works anytime

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try using Git for my Pitch Perfect Project
